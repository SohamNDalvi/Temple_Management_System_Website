          >The history of the Ayodhya Ram Mandir is centuries-old. The temple is
          built on the site believed to be the birthplace of Lord Ram, one of
          the most revered Hindu deities. The temple was demolished by the
          Mughal emperor Babur in the 16th century and a mosque was built in its
          place. The mosque, known as the Babri Masjid, stood on the site for
          centuries until it was demolished in 1992 by Hindu nationalists,
          triggering widespread violence and communal tensions in the
          country.<br /><br />The Ayodhya dispute has been a contentious issue
          in Indian politics for decades. The dispute revolved around the
          ownership of the site where the Babri Masjid stood and whether it was
          the birthplace of Lord Ram. The dispute was finally settled by the
          Indian Supreme Court in 2019, which ruled in favor of the construction
          of a Ram Janmabhoomi temple on the site. The construction of the
          temple was undertaken by the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra, a
          trust formed by the Indian government to oversee the construction of
          the temple.</span

          pilgrimage sites for Hindus. It is believed to be the birthplace of
          Lord Ram and is considered a sacred site. The construction of the
          temple is seen as a symbolic victory for the Hindu community, who had
          been fighting for the temple's construction for decades.<br /><br />The
          temple is expected to contribute to the development of Ayodhya as a
          major religious and cultural center. It is also expected to create
          jobs and generate economic growth in the region. The temple is
          expected to attract millions of devotees from across India and the
          world, contributing to the<br />development of Ayodhya as a major

          >The Ayodhya Ram Mandir is a grand temple built in the Nagara style of
          temple architecture, characterized by its towering spires or
          shikharas. The temple is built using pink sandstone and is spread
          across an area of 2.77 acres. The temple is surrounded by a large
          courtyard and has several smaller shrines dedicated to other Hindu
          deities. The most striking feature of the temple is the giant
          Shaligram stone, a black stone believed to represent Lord Ram and
          brought from the Gandaki river in Nepal.<br /><br />The temple is 161
          feet high and has three floors, each with a different purpose. The
          first floor is dedicated to Lord Ram, while the second floor is
          dedicated to Lord Hanuman, and the third floor is a museum showcasing
          the history and culture of Ayodhya.<br /><br />The temple complex also
          includes a yajnashala or a hall for conducting yajnas or Hindu fire
          rituals, a community kitchen, and a medical facility. The temple
          complex is spread over 67 acres and is expected to become a major
          cultural and religious center, attracting millions of devotees from
          around the world.</span

          in Ayodhya. Skilled artisans and craftsmen are playing a pivotal role
          in reviving traditional Indian art and craftsmanship. Intricate
          sculptures, carvings, and decorative elements crafted for the temple
          not only contribute to its grandeur but also celebrate India’s rich
          cultural heritage.<br />Beyond its cultural and religious
          significance, the Ram Mandir is acting as an economic catalyst for
          Ayodhya. The influx of pilgrims and tourists is boosting the local
          economy, creating a surge in demand for hospitality services,
          transportation, and related sectors. The government’s investments in
          infrastructure development are not only supporting the temple project
