            The controversial construction of a mosque at the disputed site was
            ordered by Mughal Emperor Babur's commander Mir Baqi. The Hindu
            community claimed that this place was the birthplace of Lord Rama,
            and there was an ancient temple at this site. Hindus asserted that
            the spot beneath one of the domes of the mosque housed Lord Rama's
            birthplace.<br /><br /></span

            >Communal riots occurred around the site where the mosque was
            constructed in 1853. Subsequently, in 1859, the British
            administration erected a fence around the disputed area, allowing
            Muslims to worship inside the mosque and granting Hindus permission
            to worship near the courtyard.<br /><br /></span

            The actual dispute over Ayodhya Ram Janmabhoomi began on September
            23, 1949, when idols of Lord Rama were found inside the mosque.
            Hindus claimed that Lord Rama had manifested himself there. The
            Uttar Pradesh government ordered the immediate removal of the idols,
            but the District Magistrate K.K. Nayar expressed his inability to
            implement the order due to the fear of hurting religious sentiments
            and inciting violence.<br /><br /></span

            On March 8, 2019, the Supreme Court referred the case for mediation
            and ordered the conclusion of the proceedings within eight weeks.
            The mediation panel presented its report on August 2, 2019, without
            achieving a resolution. The Supreme Court then commenced daily
            hearings on the Ayodhya case, and after the completion of the
            hearing on August 16, 2019, the verdict was reserved. On November 9:

        >Pran Pratishtha is a significant event in the inauguration of a temple,
        particularly in Hindu traditions. It involves the consecration of the
        deity idol, infusing it with divine energy or life force (prana),
        thereby making it a sacred and living representation of the deity.
        During the Pran Pratishtha ceremony at the Ram Mandir inauguration, the
        idol of Lord Ram is ritually installed and consecrated, signifying the
        formal commencement of worship and devotion at the temple. This process
        is conducted by highly trained priests following intricate rituals
        outlined in ancient scriptures. The ceremony typically includes various
        sacred rites such as purification of the idol, invocation of divine
        presence through prayers and mantras, offering of sacred substances like
        water, milk, honey, and perfumes, and concluding with the chanting of
        hymns and blessings. Pran Pratishtha is believed to establish a direct
        spiritual connection between the deity and the devotees, allowing them
        to commune with the divine presence embodied in the idol. It is a sacred
        and joyous occasion for devotees, symbolizing the<br />manifestation of
        divine grace and blessings within the temple precincts.<br />Overall,
        the Pran Pratishtha ceremony in the Ram Mandir inauguration marks the
        beginning of a sacred journey for devotees, inviting them to experience
        the presence and grace of Lord Ram in their lives through worship,
        devotion, and spiritual practice.</span

        transformation after the 'pran pratishtha' ceremony, as reported by
        various news sources. The sculptor, who spent months carving the idol,
        was amazed at the transformation, stating that the idol looked
        completely different after the ceremony. The 51-inch idol, portraying
        Ram Lalla as a five-year-old, was revealed to the world after the
        ceremony, with its forehead adorned with silver and red tilak and hands
        holding a golden bow and arrow. The idol was selected for its portrayal
        of innocence, divinity, and royalty. The original Ram Lalla idol, which
        was five to six inches in height, will be placed in front of the new
        idol, and two other idols will be enthroned on the first and second
        floors of the temple. All the idols will remain in the temple, as per
        the authorities. The transformation of the idol was described as a story
        of amazement and divine presence, with the sculptor attributing the
